# Stock-price-prediction-using-RNN-with-LSTM
Investing in a set of assets has never been easy; the abnormality of the financial market does not allow 
simple models to predict future asset values with greater accuracy. Machine learning, which involves 
teaching computers to perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence, is the current 
dominant trend in scientific research. The goal of this article is to create a model that predicts future stock 
market values using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and, in particular, the Long-Short Term Memory 
model (LSTM). The primary goal of this paper is to determine the precision with which a machine learning 
algorithm can predict and how much the epochs can improve our model.
We study the problem of stock market prediction using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long 
Short-Term Memory in this study (LSTM). The goal of this study is to investigate the feasibility and 
performance of RNN in tandem with LSTM in stock market predicting/forecasting. We optimize the 
LSTM model by experimenting with various configurations, such as the number of neurons in the hidden 
layers and the number of samples in sequence.
